# Verification 

The verification involves six optical modelling tools in Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) research, including: **SolTrace**, **Tonatiuh**, **Tracer**,  **Solstice**, **Heliosim** and **SolarPILOT**. Three rounds of tests were progressed to compare and verify the results from these six tools.

The details are recorded and shared in this Github repository for people who are interested. The content includs:

* **Case details**:
    - Description of the test cases
    - Parameters 
    - Heliosatat field in the Round 3 tests

* **Results**:
    - A summary of all the agreed results
        (taken from the average value of Tonatiuh, Tracer, Solstice, Soltrace and Heliosiom, 
         with the errors representing the confidence interval which follows the 3 sigma rule)
  
    - Data files from each tool for each case
    - Figures and comparison

* **Tracer script**
    - master.py: the script of running Tracer for all the test cases
    - run.py: the script of running Tracer for an individual case
    - postprocs.py: the script of postprocessing results, for comparison with other tools
    - plots: includes all the scripts for generating the comparison figures
